BASH

The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned.  To bash
someone is to attempt to 'knock' that person over.  If you succeed you
will inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on it's rear.
The victim will be unable to issue any commands for a time.  If you
miss you loose your balance and fall.  A bash makes you unable to
type commands for a time.  Note that hitting a person who is
resting/sitting will inflict more damage.

#
FRAG

Wolfshade's frag system is a 4 sided race war.  Basically if you can't see 
the other
players name you have a frag.  Unless they are below level 20 or they are 
more than 15
level below you.
How is score kept?  Well if you are solo (ie not grouped) and you are the 
killer you get
1.5 frags.  If you are grouped you get 1 frag and all members of your group 
get 1/# of members
in group.  If you get fragged you always lose one.

type 'fraglist' to see the score board
PC vs PC damage is based on the current year:
"Year of the bunny",		45 % of damage done to another PC
"Year of the lamb",		50 %
"Year of the snake",		55 %
"Year of the badger",		60 %
"Year of the tiger",		65 %
"Year of the wounded",		70 %
"Year of the massacre",		75 %
"Year of the &rbloody&n",	80 %

Anti-Paladin

The Anti-Paladins in Wolfshade are the good holy warriors.
These warriors must worship a God of Wolfshade and will receive
the same benefits to their spells as clerics do. Anti-Paladins
must remain in good standing with their God.  A God may choose
not have Anti-Paladins of his ethos, for example, Duth the
Barbarian God of Healing may not want Anti-Paladins for he is an
Good God.  Anti-Paladins do not receive a bash loss when wielding
a 2 handed weapon and have innate abilities to detect alignment,
protection from good and summon a mount.  There is no subclass
for the Anti-Paladin like there is with the Warrior, a Anti-Paladin
is a Holy Warrior and may receive benefits from their God for being
one of their chosen.  Keep in mind though that the Anti-Paladin must
be in good standing with their God for harsh punishments may come as
quickly and easily as good rewards from their God.  Anti-Paladins also
entertain a number of Spells, mostly clerical spells.  Lastly the
Anti-Paladin has the vampiric touch ability, which can restore a
fair amount of hps to him/herself every time he/she hits an enemy
with his/her hands.

These spells are:

Level		Name
Level 1: 	Curse

Level 6:	Spirit Armor

Level 11:	Cause Light Wounds

Level 16:	Cause Serious Wounds

Level 21:	Turn Undead

#
CLERIC

The Clerics of Wolfshade are the most powerful healers.
The are strong in their spells because of the presence of their god.
The cleric casts his/her spells after they have prayed for them to
their god.  A cleric's choice of God greatly affects the spell
outcome.  A Cleric must choose his/her god upon character creation.
The cleric can change gods but at a cost.  Whenever a new god comes
into the realm a "profile" will be created for that new god.

If a cleric chooses:	He/She gains:			He/She Loses:
Arkan			Better Offensive Spells		Worse Defensive Spells
Duth			Better Healing Spells		Worse Offensive Spells
Guk			Better Defensive Spells		Worse Offensive Spells

Example:  Gundledorf is a Gnome Cleric.  He's a cleric of Guk.
Flimberstein is also a Gnome Cleric but he decided to be a cleric
of Arkan.  Gundledorf casts armor on himself, it gives him at -30
to his ac, however Flimberstein casts it and only recieves a -10 to
his ac.  On the other hand, Flimberstein casts full harm on a mob and
does between 400 and 600 points of damage, where Gundledorf's full
harm only does between 200 and 400.

except they are evil.  The defiler is a cave-dweller, weapons master
and master hitter.  The defiler can be evil only.  The defiler also
has the ability to a few select mage-type spells to add to his/her
abilities.  Defilers have an innate ability to sneak in any
underground area and can summon animals at higher levels.

Druid

The Druid of Wolfshade is a basically a neutral warrior, a neutral
Ranger if you will.  The druid is a warrior who knows that evil and
good will always exist and does everything he can to balance the
power.  The Druid's spells are a culmination of clerical and mage
spells, but all have to deal with the preservation of nature.  A
Druid must always stay neutral, if his/her alignment slips too much
to one side, serious retribution can be made be that player's God.
A Druid must pray for his/her spells just like a cleric even though
some of the Druid spells may be a bit more mage-like.  Mana is
used the same way as clerics and mages.  Druids have the innate
ability to shape shift into other animals and to see evil and good.

#
Empath

The Empath of Wolfshade uses his/her will to bend the magic weave
to his/her wishes.  The empath is very much like a mage except that
there are no sub-classes for the empath and the empath does not
need to prepare his/her spells.  The empath uses mana on the fly,
willing the spells they need.  When their mana runs out the empath
must wait until the mana is restored to him/her.  Restoration can
come faster by sitting/meditating, but no preparation is needed.
Empaths "will" their spells instead of casting them.

#
Mage

As a mage on Wolfshade mud you have a lot of choices in the
direction you may wish to direct your expertise.  All sorcerers
start out the same, all the spells for any type of sorcerer are
the same up until level 15.  At level 16 the sorcerer must make a
decision for his future.  The magik of Wolfshade is split up among
the regions of the world.  This magik is known as Spheres, and they
are the following: ***see web page***

At level 16 the sorcerer must travel to the teacher who's teachings
are what the sorcerer desires.  With the aggressive nature of the
evil races the Mountain and Swamp Sphere teachers are rather easily
accessible to them, but it takes away the defensive side of magik.
Good races being kind in nature have easy access to the  protective
and defensive spells of the Tundra and Forest Sphere Teachers.
The Desert and Ocean Sphere Teachers are accessible by all, but require
more travel to reach them.

Choosing Spheres:
	When the sorcerer reaches level 16 and sits down to learn
his/her first spell from a teacher, he/she becomes a member of that
sphere.  If a sorcerer so chooses at a later date to add another sphere
to his/her spell list he/she must then travel to a teacher of that
sphere and learn a spell.  The amount of spheres one learns after one
hinders the effectiveness of all the spells that can be cast.  The
effectiveness of the spell is calculated by this equation: 100%/number
of spheres.  So this way if you have two sphere's known all your
spells will only be 50% effective as a sorcerer with only 1 sphere.
With 3 sphere's your effectiveness is only 33%, 4 sphere's it's
only 25%, 5 is 20% and 6 is 17%.  For Example, if a mage becomes a
Desert/Mountain Mage, the fireball spell will only do 50% of the full
damage and stone skin will last only 50% as long, but he/she gains
the benefit of using spells from both spheres.  If a sorcerer chooses
to become a Gray Mage, which is knowing all six sphere's he may seek
out the teacher of the gray magiks.  Gray Magik is the most powerful
magik known on Wolfshade.

Mana:
	When a sorcerer prepares for a spell, he/she uses up the mana
for that spell.  The higher the spell level the more mana used in
preparation, the circle of the spell is how many mana it requires to
prepare.  When the spell is cast the mana used in preparation is
re-released to the caster for preparation again.  Thus if a mage has
20 mana points he/she can prepare 20 1st circle spells, or
10 2nd circle spells, or 10 1st and 5 2nd circle spells or any
combination of spells he/she desires as long as there is mana to
support the preparation.

Paladin

The Paladins in Wolfshade are the good holy warriors.  These warriors
must worship a God of Wolfshade and will receive the same benefits to
their spells as clerics do.  Paladins must kill evil to gain
experience.  Paladins must remain in good standing with their God.
A God may choose not have Paladins of his ethos, for example,
Guk the Orcish God of Magic may not want Paladins for he is an evil
God.  Paladins do not receive a bash loss when wielding a 2 handed
weapon and have innate abilities to detect alignment, protection from
evil and summon a mount.  There is no subclass for the Paladin like
there is with the Warrior, a Paladin is a Holy Warrior and may
receive benefits from their God for being one of their chose.
Keep in mind though that the Paladin must be in good standing with
their God for harsh punishments may come as quickly and easily as
good rewards from their God.  Paladins also entertain a number of
Spells, mostly clerical spells.  Lastly the Paladin has the ability
to lay hands , which can restore a fair amount of hps to the target.
These spells are:

Level		Name
Level 1: 	Bless

Level 6:	Spirit Armor

Level 11:	Cure Serious Wounds

#
Psionicist

The Psionicist of Wolfshade uses his/her mind to bend the magic
weave to his/her thoughts.  The psionicist is very much like a mage
except that there is no sub-classes for the psionicist and the
psionicist does not need to prepare his/her spells.  The psionicist
uses mana on the fly, thinking the spells they need.  When their mana
runs out the psionicist must wait until the mana is restored to
him/her.  Restoration can come faster by sitting/meditating, but no
preparation is needed.  Psionicists "think" their spells instead of
casting them.

The Rangers in Wolfshade are much like a ranger in any other mud.

select mage-type spells to add to his/her abilities.  Rangers have

ROGUE

The Rogue is a very versatile class on Wolfshade. The class is a
three tiered system.

Choosing to play a Rogue gets the rogue a set of base abilities.
When a Second Tier is chosen he/she gains abilities assigned to that
group.  The Rogue gets additional +'s to each ability in that group.
  With the first Second Tier ability the rogue gets a +2 to all of
those abilities.  With the first Tier 3 ability the rogue gains an
additional +1.  With each new group of abilities added a + is taken away.

Example: Lokke is a Rogue.  He decided to be a swindler.  His Thief
abilities in Disguise and Pick Lock gains him +2 and his swindler
abilities in Beg, Con, Intimidate etc gain a +1.  Later he decided
he wants to do some killing so he learns to be an assassin, tracking,
wield 2h and shadow subtract 1 from the bonuses for the brigand tier,
then he also loses 1 for becoming the assassin.  So Lokke has gained
all the abilities from being a swindler and an assassin, but he only
receives a +1 to those abilities and his thief swindler abilities.
(+2 for being a thief, +1 for swindler, -1 for Brigand, -1 for Assassin
  = +1 to abilities) If he would add any other ability profile he
would lose the +'s.

Shaman

The Shaman of Wolfshade are the spiritual casters of the realm.  A
shaman's spells are based upon known magic much like that of a mage,
but there are no sub-classes for the Shaman so every spell a shaman
gets can be expected to work the same every time.  A shaman must
memorize his spells, much like practicing from a mage.  The shaman
must have a totem to memorize his/her spells.  The Shaman has the
battle skills of a cleric and the spells of a mage but neither are
as powerful as the cleric or mage. The Shaman have 3 Sphere's of
influence, Animal, Nature and Body/Spirit, but they may not choose

The Warrior of Wolfshade is the heart and soul of any group.  The
warrior is the one in the group that will take the damage, deal the
damage and anchor a party.  The warrior, like the rogue, has options
open to him to where he/she wishes to go.  Choosing to play a Warrior
gets the rogue a set of base abilities.  When a Second Tier is chosen
he/she gains abilities assigned to that group.  The Warrior gets
additional +'s to each ability in that group.  With the first Second
Tier ability the warrior gets a +2 to all of those abilities.  With
the first Tier 3 ability the warrior gains an additional +1.  With
each new group of abilities added a + is taken away.  See Rogue for

MANA
When a spellcaster (non-psionicist/empath) prepares for a spell,
he/she uses up the mana for that spell.
The higher the spell level the more mana used in
preparation, the circle of the spell is how many mana it requires to
prepare.  When the spell is cast the mana used in preparation is
re-released to the caster for preparation again.  Thus if a mage has
20 mana points he/she can prepare 20 1st circle spells, or
10 2nd circle spells, or 10 1st and 5 2nd circle spells or any
combination of spells he/she desires as long as there is mana to
support the preparation.
The spellcaster can "fastcast" or "fcast" without preparing the spell
but it will cost 4 times the normal amount of mana and will regenerate 
slowly.

multi-playing
Multi-playing is the playing of more than one character at the same time by
one person.

Our rules on Multiplaying:

1. You may not have more than one character logged in at any given time.
Yes, this includes LINK-DEAD characters as well.  You must log your
character out via RENT or CAMP before you bring on a different character.
The only exception being if both characters are logged in at the same INN.
(INN meaning the same room where you rent, not rooms immediately adjacent or
otherwise.)

2. You may not bring on another character for the sake of retrieving
equipment for a character that has died.

3. You may not use a second character to help another one of your 
characters, no matter
what the purpose.  This includes spell casting, hurting a mob, etc.

4. You absolutely may NOT bring on a character from an opposing side of the
racewars and use it to pass information to another of your characters or
other people on your side of the racewars.  EXAMPLE:  Say Multiboy is a
Pixie and nearly dies to an Illithid who happened to be raiding.  Multiboy
camps and then logs in as an Illithid to learn the whereabouts of the
Illithid who nearly killed him and waits until said Illithid has left the
area where his Pixie camped.  When the coast is clear, he then rents his
Illithid and essentially "passes the info" on to his Pixie and/or other
members of his side of the    racewars.  This also goes for people who log
on other side chars just to see who is on.

5. You may not log on another character to take revenge for another of your
character that was just killed, nor may you use another character to assist
in any way in taking revenge until at least 30 RL minutes have passed.

   Example1:  Multiboytoo is Multiboy's secondary character.  Multiboytoo is
minding his own business when Multikiller walks in and kills him.  Shortly
after Multiboytoo is killed, Multiboy logs in and attacks Multikiller.  BAD
BAD Multiboy!  Even if Multikiller doesn't    die as a result of Multiboy's
attack, Multiboy is still doing something very illegal in the lands of
Wolfshade.

   Example2:  Multiboy, who is normally a Pixie on the Good side, has a
secondary, Multimul, who is a Mul on the Neutral side.  Multimul runs into
an Orc from the Evil side and the Orc kills him.  Multiboy then logs in and
tells other members of the Good side of the racewar the whereabouts of the
Orc, thus assisting them in getting revenge, and also passing info from one
side to another.  Will he never learn?!

6. You MUST wait at least 30 minutes between the time you log out a
character and log in another from an opposing side of the racewars.

We realize some of these rules may be hard to enforce, and we may not be
able to catch everyone who breaks them, but when we DO catch you, you will
regret it.  As an example, you may lose half of the levels on all the
characters involved, or you may just be deleted. It depends on the God who
catches you.

NOTE:  ANYONE WHO KNOWINGLY ACCEPTS INFORMATION FROM SOMEONE WHO IS
MULTIPLAYING AND DOES NOT REPORT THE OFFENDER WILL FACE PUNISHMENT AS WELL.

If you require clarification on these rules, ask a God.  Do NOT take
chances!  Ignorance is NOT an excuse.

   Example1:  Multiboytoo is Multiboy's secondary character.  Multiboytoo is
minding his own business when Multikiller walks in and kills him.  Shortly
after Multiboytoo is killed, Multiboy logs in and attacks Multikiller.  BAD
BAD Multiboy!  Even if Multikiller doesn't    die as a result of Multiboy's
attack, Multiboy is still doing something very illegal in the lands of
Wolfshade.

   Example2:  Multiboy, who is normally a Pixie on the Good side, has a
secondary, Multimul, who is a Mul on the Neutral side.  Multimul runs into
an Orc from the Evil side and the Orc kills him.  Multiboy then logs in and
tells other members of the Good side of the racewar the whereabouts of the
Orc, thus assisting them in getting revenge, and also passing info from one
side to another.  Will he never learn?!

6. You MUST wait at least 30 minutes between the time you log out a
character and log in another from an opposing side of the racewars.

We realize some of these rules may be hard to enforce, and we may not be
able to catch everyone who breaks them, but when we DO catch you, you will
regret it.  As an example, you may lose half of the levels on all the
characters involved, or you may just be deleted. It depends on the God who
catches you.

NOTE:  ANYONE WHO KNOWINGLY ACCEPTS INFORMATION FROM SOMEONE WHO IS
MULTIPLAYING AND DOES NOT REPORT THE OFFENDER WILL FACE PUNISHMENT AS WELL.

If you require clarification on these rules, ask a God.  Do NOT take
chances!  Ignorance is NOT an excuse.
